<h3>What is Goal 9?</h3>
<p>Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation</p>
<h3>Why is Goal 9 important?</h3>
<p>Many people around the world do not have access to proper infrastructure. </p>
<p>Because of this there are many things that they cannot do which you might take for granted.</p>
<p>Without access to some key things such as roads, people can't improve their situation in life.</p>
<p>Using the above example of roads, if you didn't have roads you cannot transport goods to other places.</p>
<p>This would stop you from being able to make money since you can't sell your product.</p>
<p>There are many other important bits of infrastructure that many people don't have.</p>
<p>By acheiveing this goal we can pave the road to other goals we need to acheive.</p>
