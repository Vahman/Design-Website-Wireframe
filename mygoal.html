   <h4>I believe that everybody should have access to proper infrastructure. Roads are a piece of infrastructure which are crucial to being able to do many things much easier. Roads can help with travel but they are also able to help people with the transport of goods such as crops the harvested. Bridges are another form of infrastructure. Without bridges travelling from places seperated by water can be very difficult to do. Cell towers are also infrastructure. They can help us with being able to communicate with other who are far away. The internet can also be considered to be infrastructure. It allows people to do many things such as see things like traffic or learn more about a topic. Proper infrastructure lets us do many things. Without it you can see that our lives would be much harder. This is why we need to make sure that everybody has access to proper infrastructure.
